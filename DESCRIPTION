Description:
    A database of Chinese surnames and given names (1930-2008).
    This database contains nationwide frequency statistics of
    1,806 Chinese surnames and 2,614 Chinese characters used in given names,
    covering about 1.2 billion Han Chinese population
    (96.8 percent of the Han Chinese household-registered population
    born from 1930 to 2008 and still alive in 2008).
    This package also contains a function for computing multiple indices of
    Chinese surnames and given names for social science research (e.g.,
    name uniqueness, name gender, name valence, and name warmth/competence).
