Description:
  A database of Chinese surnames and Chinese given names (1930-2008).
  This database contains nationwide frequency statistics of
  1,806 Chinese surnames and 2,614 Chinese characters used in given names,
  covering about 1.2 billion Han Chinese population
  (96.8% of the Han Chinese household-registered population
  born from 1930 to 2008 and still alive in 2008).
  This package also contains a function for computing multiple features of
  Chinese surnames and Chinese given names for scientific research (e.g.,
  name uniqueness, name gender, name valence, and name warmth/competence).
